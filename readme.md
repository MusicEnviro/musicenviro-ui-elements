# music-related UI elements

WIP
some ideas:

-   musical keyboard
-   note sequence designer
-   piano roll
-   drum grid
-   waveform viewer
-   DAW-type region editor
-   Guitar tabs, chord diagrams

## UI test feature

We render the component all by itself on a test page, just open simple-client/index.html in browser. Edit `src/simple-client/index.js' to choose which component to preview.

for development: run `tsc --watch` in one window for created js files in /lib, and `npm run watch` in another to run watchify and create the bundle.js
